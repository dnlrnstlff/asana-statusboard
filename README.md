Asana Statusboard
=================

> Display your Asana projects &amp; their details using Panic's Statusboard app.

How it works
------------

The app grabs all projects from a specific workspace id and their project description. We treat the description as the overall status of the project. The app color codes the project based on keywords found in the description.

**Current Keywords:** queued, on hold, done, to print, waiting, proofed, comps sent

Setup
-----

    git clone https://github.com/sheck/asana-statusboard.git
    cd asana-statusboard
    heroku create
    git push heroku master

This lightweight ruby app runs on sinatra and is ready to be deployed on Heroku. To complete the setup, you will need:

1. Statusboard App for iPad
2. Git
3. Heroku
4. Basic knowledge of both
5. And a Heroku account
    
Usage
-----

1. In Statusboard, add a new Table widget
2. Enter the following for your URL:

##### http://[your-app-name].herokuapp.com/[your-api-key]/[your-workspace-id]
